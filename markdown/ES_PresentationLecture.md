# Spacecrafts

## What are spacecrafts
 - Vehicle made to fly in space regardless of human presence inside.
 - First one launched was the "Telstar 1" used to transmit TV Signals.


## Types of Spacecrafts 
 
### Flyby Spacecraft
 - Examples: Voyager 1 and 2.
 - Orbit planets and suns and recording data while they travel.
 
### Orbiter Spacecrafts
 - Focuses on studying a single planet.
 - Able to perform more detailed experiments as they are with the planets forloonger.

### Atmospheric Spacecraft
 - Example: Huygens Probe.
 - Have no engine and stays within the atmosphere. 
 - Able to collect data on air composition and pressure.
 
### Example: The Apollo Spacecraft
 - Landed the first humans on the moon.
 
 
## Space Station 
 - Complex structure built to stay within earth orbit, with astronauts living and doing reserach in the labs in outer space.
 - Can be categorized into Monolithic (one piece) and Modular (combined from multiple vehicles + docked on orbit)
 - Some significant examples are Salyut, Skylab, Mir, and the International Space Station (ISS).

## Satellites
 - A body orbitting around a planet, both manmade and natural.
 - First one: Sputnik, launched by the Soviets.
 - Nowadays, it is used for telecommunications, geographical mappings, and military purposes.
 
 
## Types of Satellites
 - Communication: phone calls, internet, and TV Signals.
 - Earth Observation: weather prediction, view environmental changes, and map earth's surface.
 - Navigation: GPS for phones, vehicles, and smart devices.
 - Scientific: Extends beyond earth's orbit to study stuff outside the earth.
 - CubeSats: Budget boxes used by high schools, universities, and startups to do space research.
